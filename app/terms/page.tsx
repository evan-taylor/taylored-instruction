          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-text">Reschedule and Refund Policy</h3>
          <p>At Taylored Instruction, we do not offer refunds for course registrations. Instead, we provide the flexibility to reschedule your registration. Please review the following guidelines:</p>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-text">Rescheduling Policy</h4>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-text-light">
            <li>Rescheduling requests made <strong>7 or more days</strong> before the scheduled start date will incur no additional charges.</li>
            <li>Rescheduling requests made <strong>less than 7 days</strong> before the scheduled start date will incur a $20 administrative fee.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-text">Refund Exceptions</h4>
          <p>Refunds are only provided if no courses of the type you registered for are forecasted to be available within the next 3 months. In such cases, a refund will be issued minus a $20 administrative fee.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-text mt-8">eLearning Policy</h3>
          <p>Blended learning courses require completion of eLearning modules prior to the in-person session. Failure to complete the eLearning will prevent participation in the course. Refunds are not available in these cases, but we encourage you to contact us for assistance if you anticipate delays in completing the required materials.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-text mt-8">Prerequisites</h3>
          <p>Some of our courses may have prerequisites. Please review the course description carefully when you sign up for a course. We are not able to offer a refund in the event that you are not able to complete the course due to not meeting the prerequisites. If you have any questions about the prerequisites, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@tayloredinstruction.com" className="text-primary hover:underline">info@tayloredinstruction.com</a>.</p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-text mt-8">Late Arrivals</h3>
          <p>All of our courses begin on time and promptly. If you arrive more than 10 minutes late to your course, you will have already missed content, and may not be eligible to participate. In such a case, you may reschedule your registration for a fee of $20.</p>
          <p>In exceptional cases, refunds or adjustments may be considered at Taylored Instruction's sole discretion. Please contact us for individual review.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 text-text mt-12">Return and Refund Policy for Online Shop</h2>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-text">Digital Goods</h3>
          <p>All digital goods, including eBooks, course access codes, and eCards, are not eligible for a refund once they have been delivered. Please review product details carefully before purchase.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-text">Physical Goods</h3>
          <p>Physical goods are eligible for a refund within 30 days of purchase, provided they are returned in their original, unopened packaging. To initiate a return, please contact us with your order details at <a href="mailto:info@tayloredinstruction.com" className="text-primary hover:underline">info@tayloredinstruction.com</a>.
